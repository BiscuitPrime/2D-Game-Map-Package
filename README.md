# 2D Game Map Package

A simple unity package that will help you create a controllable 2D Game Map.

### Features :
The [GameMapController.cs] component can be added to the object you wish to make a game map.
The Map can be moved (limited by the screen by default, can be adjusted in the editor), and is entirely modular : it will adjust, even in runtime, to the sprite regardless of the latter's size, shape or scale.
